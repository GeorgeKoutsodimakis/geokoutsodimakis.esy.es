          My friends call me Kou (out of my last name Koutsodimakis).
          I am a web and mobile developer becauce it's the thing I do the best but I design of love for beautifull things.
          For years I was trying to be a classic programmer specialized in Java,but it has no fun at all.
          So web development/design won me over ,cause it's far more creative,artistic and direct.<br>
          I love what I do and I am very passionate in every aspect of my life. I am always trying to give the best of me.
          Moreover I am always trying to learn new thinks , experimenting with new technologies and searching for the best results.
